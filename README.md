# Pneumonia-detection
Pneumonia is a common illness affecting approximately 450 million people a year and occurring in all parts of the world. 
If healthcare workers cannot diagnose correctly, pneumonia may be mistreated. In some regions, the high death rate of pneumonia 
can be caused due to the shortage of medical resources and healthcare workers.

Chest X-rays (CXRs) are widely applied for pneumonia diagnosis due to their low cost and efficiency. However, 
it requires professional experience to read and analyze the result from CXR. Since the CXR reading process is repetitive 
and time-consuming, using a well-trained machine learning model to read and diagnose pneumonia can significantly improve 
efficiency and minimize labour overhead. Notably, machine learning methods like deep neural networks show the potential in 
solving the problem with abundance of data. 

The goal of this project is to design a neural network architecture for pneumonia image classification tasks.
